# mcp-bastion-console

The TypeScript component of [MCP Bastion](../README.md): a **dependency-free**
(Node standard library only) viewer for audit logs and policies.

The only `devDependencies` are `typescript` and `@types/node` — both used at
build time to compile the sources. Nothing is required at runtime.

## Build & test

```sh
npm install       # installs the build-time devDependencies
npm run build     # tsc -> dist/
npm test          # node --test over compiled tests
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

## Usage

```sh
node dist/cli.js report <audit.jsonl> [--json] [--decision D] [--tool S]
node dist/cli.js tail   <audit.jsonl> [--decision D]
node dist/cli.js policy <policy-file>
```

- **report** — aggregate an audit log: decision counts, per-tool activity,
  redaction tallies, byte totals. Cross-checks the gateway's own summary line
  and exits non-zero on mismatch. `--json` emits a machine-readable object;
