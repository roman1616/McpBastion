//! Structured audit events.
//!
//! Every decision the gateway makes emits exactly one audit event as a single
//! line of JSON to the audit sink (stderr by default, or a file). The console
//! viewer in `../console` consumes these lines. Events are hand-serialised with
//! the standard library only, so the schema below is the single source of
//! truth.
//!
//! Event schema (all fields always present unless noted):
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "ts_ms":        1234,        // milliseconds since process start
//!   "seq":          1,           // monotonically increasing line counter
//!   "decision":     "forward",   // forward | deny | drop | error
//!   "reason":       "allow_tool read_file",
//!   "method":       "tools/call",// extracted, or null
//!   "tool":         "read_file", // extracted for tools/call, or null
//!   "id":           "7",         // raw id span text, or null
//!   "bytes_in":     128,
//!   "bytes_out":    120,         // 0 when not forwarded
//!   "redacted":     ["token"],   // redacted argument keys
