# Protocol & I/O Contract

MCP Bastion sits between an MCP **client** and an MCP **server**, on the
`stdio` transport that MCP defines. It is a byte-level relay with policy:

```
client ──stdin──▶ mcp-bastion ──stdout──▶ server
                      │
                      └──audit (stderr or file)
```
